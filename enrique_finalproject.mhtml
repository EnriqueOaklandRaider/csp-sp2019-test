     <h1>OakTown,California</h1>
     <h2> Hello! I am Enrique Del Toro, and I am 14 years old. I am from https://www.google.com/search?q=oakland+california&rlz=1CAZIWS_enUS813&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=
     X&ved=0ahUKEwii5tzcjYbjAhVHjFQKHX3UDgYQ_AUIEigD&biw=1366&bih=609&safe=active&ssui=on:">Oakland</a>, California. I moved up to Seattle in 
     December 2014, and it was hard leaving all of my other family members and friends, and everything that I loved, and just having to start 
     a new life. Football, rap, and family have helped me out a lot. I decided to talk about my hometown because I am proud of where I came 
     from and would like to share some stuff about The Town. </h2>
     <h2> Oakland,California is located in the California Bay Area not too far by San Fransisco and San Jose. It is located In 
     Alameda County in the San Fransisco East Bay and is home to about 430k people. It is the largest city in the county, 8th
     in the state, and 47th in the US. It was made a city in May of 1852, but confirmed in March 1854. Oakland sometimes goes by 
     the names OakTown,the Town,and the City of Dope just to name a few. Oakland is also well known for its crime, as it is one 
     of the more dangerous cities in the country, which has a crime rate of 74.38 per 1000 residents. </h2>
      There are many big things to do in Oakland and I will show you some things in my opinion you must do when you visit
      the Bay Area or Oakland in general:

              </h2>
                 </h2> There are many other places to visit in Oakland such as the Chabot Space and Science Center, San Fransico Bay Trail, and
                 Children's Fairlyland, but would be too much things for my list. Oakland is also home to many celebrities that you all know and 
                 love today. Here are top 5 people from the Town that you may know:
